Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
The main objective of Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is to use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.
The steps included here are:
1.Read and understand the data
2. Exploratory Analysis.
3. Normalization of data
4. Visualization of correlations
5. Model Architecture-(Logistic Regression,SupportVectorClassifier,KNeighborsClassifier,Random Forest Classifier,DecisionTreeClassifier)
6. Model Evaluation and Prediction
Conclusion:
The highest accuracy is obtained by using Logistic Regression(85%), KNeighbors Classifier(94%) and RandomForestClassifier(95%).
